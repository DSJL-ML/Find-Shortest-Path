# Find-Shortest-Path
Find the shortest path to connect all the vertices in a graph

## Summary
This is a classical problem to find the shortest path to connect all the vertices in a graph. 2 solutions are provided based on the implementation of 2 classical algorithms: [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Find-Shortest-Path/blob/master/shortest_path_Dijkstras_Algorithm.py) and [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://github.com/ljj-ml/Find-Shortest-Path/blob/master/shortest_path_Kruskals_Algorithm.py).

## Software
The code is written in Python 3.5.
