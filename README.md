# Find-Shortest-Path
Find the shortest path to connect all the vertices in a graph

## Summary
This is a classical problem to find the shortest path to connect all the vertices in a graph. 2 solutions are provided based on the implementation of 2 classical algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm.

## Software
The code is written in Python 3.5.
